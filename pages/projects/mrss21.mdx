# MARTINE ROSE SS21

Yes, I did model in Paris Fashion Week. I worked with U.K. menswear designer [Martine Rose](https://martine-rose.com/) and her team on their SS21 virtual show. It was a surreal, super cool experience, and I get a lot of questions about it.

Long story short - I used to take daily pictures of my outfits on Instagram over quarantine. A casting agency found the account and reached out asking if I was interested in modeling. Duh, I said yes. Then, I worked with Martine Rose and her team to coordinate the shoot. I set up a tripod and filmed myself hanging out in my childhood bedroom in pieces from her Spring/Summer 2021 collection.

This is a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnZM9NJzuTM) about the shoot!
