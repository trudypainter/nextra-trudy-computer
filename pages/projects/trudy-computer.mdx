# TRUDY.COMPUTER 

![](/trudy-computer/2.jpg)

### Intentions 

I wanted to make a website from scratch. I think [handmade websites](https://gossipsweb.net/) are [awesome](https://tilde.town/~zach/folk-html.html) and can be a great form of self expression. 

There are lots of great [website generators](https://cargo.site/), but I wanted my website to be fully customizable and learn new skills during development. 

When thinking about the [design of my personal website](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-make-a-website-for-your-creative-work/), I wanted to balance representing myself personally and professionally. 

I want to feel comfortable sending my website to friends AND employers. 

 

### System Specs 

A lot of my minimalist/bruatlist web design inspiration is collected in this [Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/trudy-painter/ui-ux-e7l6cz6uksa). 

The frontend is made with React. The backend is a Flask web server (hosted on Heroku) that turns Notion pages → to Markdown → into HTML. You can look at how the system was made in [this repository](https://github.com/trudypainter/trudy-computer-react). 

### Interface Design 

Below is the frontend interface from my initial design stages. You may notice that the original project grid included pictures. And, my personal website did include thumbnail pictures for a long time.

However, there were 2 issues with this. [1] The landing page took too long to load and [2] I got super interested in sustainable web design and decided that image thumbnails weren’t essential.

### Notion CMS 

At first, I used a custom content management system before. There are plenty of CMS frameworks out there (like [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) for example), but I wanted to design my own.  

So my approach was to dedicate folders to [a] a JSON of project metadata, [b] a markdown file of the project writeup, and [c] store all the images in the same directory.

Fine. This worked. But I hated the process of creating a new directory → writing in my code editor → pushing to Github → waiting for the web app to compile → checking how it looked → maybe making changes…. not smooth. 

I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). And then I realized Notion has a good [API](https://developers.notion.com/). So why don’t I just reduce the friction of the workflow above by using Notion as a backend?

### Database Metadata 

I implemented my Notion backend by using the database above as, well, my database. All of the pages in the database link to project pages.  

Entries also have fields of metadata. They have [a] descriptions, [b] a location, and [c] topic tags. These fields are displayed in project cards on my landing page. 

Entries also have a priority number. I ran into the issue that the database query doesn’t return entries in a specific order (it is random). And I want to control the order of the projects in my grid. So, I gave each project a number. The projects I care about the least got a 1. The projects that I care about more get higher numbers. I chose this numbering system because as I add new projects, I’ll just give them a higher number - there is no upper bound. Then, when I query the database, I can sort by priority number to get the project ordering I want. 

Entries also have slugs that routes to the project’s writeup. So [www.trudy.computer/trudy-computer](http://www.trudy.computer/trudy-computer) will return this project’s writeup. 

### Project Writeup Rendering 

To get the content for the project page, I convert a Notion page → Markdown → HTML. I did this manually so I had complete control over the display of projects (and I was curious what the process of doing it was like).
